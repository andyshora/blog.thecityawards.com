  <p>Although our launch was famously meat-themed, it's the opposite crowd who have come forth and made sure our second award is in their hands!</p>
  <p>The race to find the Best Vegetarian in London is well and truly on. <a href="http://www.thecityawards.com/best-vegetarian-in-london#venue-gAlJEFx6z1" title="The Gate, Islington">The Gate in Islington</a> have taken quite a commanding lead from the venues on our shortlist, taking in over 50% of the vote. However, voting has just begun, and it's still not too late to nominate your favourite venue if you don't see them on the list.</p>
  <p>Remember to tweet your vote with the hashtag #BestVegetarianInLondon for your chance to win a free meal for two at one of the venues this month!</p>

          <p><div class="grab">
  <p>Thousands of Londoners have been voting for the first City Award, and we're delighted to announce that Tommi's Burger Joint have taken the prize for the #BestBurgerInLondon in 2014!</p>
  <p>Tommi's have beaten off some fierce competition for the award, including strong contenters in Patty &amp; Bun and Burger Bear, but the King's Road (and now Marylebone) -based burger joint soon raced into an unassailable lead, taking almost 25% of the votes for the 16 restaurants!
