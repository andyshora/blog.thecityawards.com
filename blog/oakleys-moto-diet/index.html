          I <a href="/blog/oakleys-monster-page-of-baubles/">recently blogged</a> some crticism about a site which had an 85MB home page. At the time of writing, <a href="http://moto.oakley.com">Oakley's Moto</a> site was the most dramatic example I had ever seen of an excessively enhanced, heavyweight single page site.  Since then, the team at Oakley have responded by putting the site on a diet and dramatically improving its performance and footprint. Great stuff!

<p>
    My criticisms of the site provoked some conversation on Twitter. Many people echoed my surprise at such an excessive page weight, others argued that this was a great example of pushing the boundaries of the web.
</p>
<p>
    Notably though, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshaustin/status/326735602424889345">Josh Austin</a>, a member of the team at Oakley contacted me to say thanks for bringing my concerns to his attention. I was impressed by this as it's not easy to hear criticisms of something you've worked hard on. Indeed, not everyone took the criticism with such good grace. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
    And so I was delighted when Josh contacted me again to let me know that a number of optimisations had been implemented, and that I should take another look.
</p>

<h3>Credit where credit is due</h3>
<p>
    The result of the efforts at Oakley was that a new version of the page (which has the same aesthetic and functionality as far as I can tell) was deployed with a <em>drastically</em> reduced page weight.
</p>


<h3>Comparing the footprints</h3>
<p>The original site:</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>85.4MB page weight</li>
        <li>471 HTTP requests</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And now the recently revised site:</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>13.6MB page weight</li>
        <li>285 HTTP requests</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
    That's a saving of more than 70MB! That's huge!
</p>
<p>
    I'm still not really a fan of this kind of site, and 13MB for a single page is still very large indeed, but this is a fantastic optimisation when you consider where the original version. Bravo to the Oakley team for revisiting this and making such good improvements.
