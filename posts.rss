  &lt;p&gt;Although our launch was famously meat-themed, it&#39;s the opposite crowd who have come forth and made sure our second award is in their hands!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The race to find the Best Vegetarian in London is well and truly on. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecityawards.com/best-vegetarian-in-london#venue-gAlJEFx6z1&quot; title=&quot;The Gate, Islington&quot;&gt;The Gate in Islington&lt;/a&gt; have taken quite a commanding lead from the venues on our shortlist, taking in over 50% of the vote. However, voting has just begun, and it&#39;s still not too late to nominate your favourite venue if you don&#39;t see them on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remember to tweet your vote with the hashtag #BestVegetarianInLondon for your chance to win a free meal for two at one of the venues this month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Londoners have been voting for the first City Award, and we&#39;re delighted to announce that Tommi&#39;s Burger Joint have taken the prize for the #BestBurgerInLondon in 2014!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tommi&#39;s have beaten off some fierce competition for the award, including strong contenters in Patty &amp;amp; Bun and Burger Bear, but the King&#39;s Road (and now Marylebone) -based burger joint soon raced into an unassailable lead, taking almost 25% of the votes for the 16 restaurants!
