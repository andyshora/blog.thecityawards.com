    A few nice folks around the web have been sharing visualisations of the most popular viewport sizes appearing in the analytics for their sites. I thought these were beautiful and useful and wanted to make it easier for people to create their own and highlight the need for responsive web design.

  Lara Hogan of Etsy <a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/516660720378052608">published the first which caught my eye</a>. Etsy are doing great work when it comes to sharing their learning about site performance and optimisations. This was just another example of that.

<p>
  Shortly after this image surfaced on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/seanstopnik/status/516711485507403776">Sean Stopnik</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunbent/status/516922521455951872">Shaun Bent</a> both created and shared their own visulisations from Bestbuy and BBC Sport. Lovely stuff. Thanks for sharing, fellas!
</p>
<p>
  I decided to print these lovely images and display them on the wall in the <a href="http://rga.com">R/GA London</a> office. They serve as a nice reminder to all of us, developers and designers alike, that the web is squishy, and that we need to design and build for all manner of unknowns.

<h2>Make your own with Viewportify</h2>
<p>
  It was <a href="https://twitter.com/yoanngrange/status/517038913551351809">quickly suggested</a> that there must already be a tool on the web to generate these images rather than crafting them in Photoshop. To my surprise, I could find nothing that would do it for me... so I cobbled something together.
</p>
<p>
  Enter <a href="http://viewportify.hawksworx.com">Viewportify</a>. A simple little tool which will turn a blob of analytics data about the viewports used to view your site, into an image you can share, save, print or whatever. It's clunky but it seems to work. I used it to create the graph on this page, which you can see <a href="http://viewportify.hawksworx.com/graph/d-d10C">in all its glory over here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I'd love to see the gallery of visualisations or <em>graphs</em> grow as people generate and contribute their own.
